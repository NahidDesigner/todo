## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: App not loading
**Solution:**
- Check if all files are uploaded to `public_html`
- Verify file names are exactly: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Issue: Styling not working
**Solution:**
- Ensure `styles.css` is in the same folder as `index.html`
- Check if Font Awesome CDN is accessible
- Verify Google Fonts are loading

### Issue: JavaScript not working
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure `script.js` is in the same folder as `index.html`
- Verify file permissions are set to `644`

### Issue: Data not saving
**Solution:**
- Check if localStorage is enabled in your browser
- Try accessing the app in incognito/private mode
- Verify no browser extensions are blocking localStorage

## ðŸ“± Mobile Testing
After deployment, test your app on:
- **Mobile phones** (iOS and Android)
- **Tablets** (iPad, Android tablets)
- **Different browsers** (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations
- **HTTPS**: Enable SSL certificate in Hostinger for secure access
- **File permissions**: Keep files at `644` and folders at `755`
- **Regular backups**: Export your data regularly using the app's export feature

## ðŸ“Š Performance Optimization
- **Enable Gzip compression** in Hostinger control panel
- **Use CDN** for Font Awesome and Google Fonts (already configured)
- **Minimize HTTP requests** (already optimized in the app)
